# Security follow-ups (backend)

Tracked, NOT fixed on `hotfix/admin-routes-missing-auth`. Recorded during the
privilege-escalation fix for the admin user-mutation and care-team routes.

## 1. `role.user_id` needs a UNIQUE constraint — RESOLVED (`43706f2`)
- Added `UNIQUE(role.user_id)` via `20260819120000_add_unique_role_user_id.js`
  (defensive dedup keeping the most-privileged row, then the constraint). This
  makes `updateUserRole`'s `INSERT ... ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE` behave as intended.

## 2. `getUserRoleType` most-privileged-wins — RESOLVED (`43706f2`)
- `getUserRoleType` and the new `findRoleByUserId` now order by privilege
  (super-admin > admin > clinician > patient), not newest-wins. All three
  session-issuing paths (login, verifyOtpController, refresh) resolve role by
  `user_id`. `UNIQUE(users.username)` also added
  (`20260819120100_add_unique_users_username.js`); settings username change now
  returns 409 on conflict.

## 3. OTP generation uses `Math.random()` — RESOLVED for login (`c94e134`)
- Login OTP now uses `crypto.randomInt(100000, 1000000)`
  (`controllers/auth.controller.js`). Note: `services/mfa.service.js` still uses
  `Math.random()`, but that path is dormant (imported, not called). Convert it if
  it is ever reactivated.

## 4. Production MySQL root credentials are `root`/`root` — rotate
- Confirmed on the box today: prod MySQL uses `root`/`root`, stored in
  `/home/ubuntu/22-rpm/rpm-backend/.env`. Needs credential rotation (a scoped
  app user, not root) on a scheduled window. Not blocking a code merge, but a
  standing infrastructure risk.

## 5. Production working tree had drifted from git — process, not code
- During deploy prep (2026-08-19) the box's `server.js` was found to carry an
  uncommitted, load-bearing CORS change (origins pointed at
  `api.twentytwohealth.com`) that existed nowhere in git. Deploying `main` as-is
  would have silently reverted it and broken the dashboard for every user. The
  change has since been brought into `main` (`e9d9901`), but the underlying
  problem is infrastructural: files are being edited directly on the production
  box, so the deployed state is not reproducible from the repo and every deploy
  risks clobbering unrecorded changes.
- This is an infrastructure/process issue, not a code defect. For Husnain:
  production should be deployed only from committed refs, with no manual edits on
  the box; if a hotfix must be made on the box, it needs to be committed and
  pushed the same day. Consider a pre-deploy `git status` gate that refuses to
  deploy when the working tree is dirty.
